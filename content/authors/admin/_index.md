Hello! I'm a climate nerd who spent too much time doom scrolling IPCC reports and decided to be part of the 
renewable energy transition. I am a clean energy consultant working on county and state-level energy issues in the West. 
My ecosystem ecology background helps me feel comfortable with big-picture policy analyses, but I've learned that sometimes you need to have more coffee & windshield time with the locals to solve problems.

I started my career working for the Forest Service in Alaska and Oregon building long-term forest management plans. 
My curiosity of the natural world led me to purse a PhD researching how climate change is impacting ecosystems like deserts, grasslands, forests, 
and agricultural areas. My academic specialties include fire effects on ecosystems, permafrost, and nature based carbon markets. While at Oregon State, I co-produced the 
[Inspiration Dissemination]({{< relref "/project/inspiration_dissemination_memorable_episodes" >}}) 
radio show, podcast, & blog where we translated graduate student research for the public's understanding. 

After completing my academic work, I became Idaho Conservation League's Climate Program Manager where I co-developed a 
long-term campaign to accelerate Idaho's path to decarbonization focused on buildings, transportation, agriculture issues, but focused on the energy grid. 
Although I started as an tree-hugging ecologist, clean energy-issues are now my life's work. 

When not working you can find me running in circles, mountain biking, or playing soccer. Learn more [about me]({{< relref "/project/Background" >}}).
