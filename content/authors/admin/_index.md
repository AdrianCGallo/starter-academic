Hello! I’m a PhD candidate currently focusing on carbon and nutrient cycling in wildland ecosystems to better understand the future impacts of climate change on our environment. But, as a future career I’m exploring science communication and climate change adaptation policy through an environmental justice framework. You can find links to my conferences presentations and journal publications below.

When not science-ing you can find me running in circles, mountain biking, playing soccer, or interviewing people on a podcast I co-host, [Inspiration Dissemination]({{< relref "/project/inspiration_dissemination_memorable_episodes" >}}). To learn more about my history read my [Background]({{< relref "/project/Background" >}}).
