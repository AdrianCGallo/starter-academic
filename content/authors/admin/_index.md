Hello! I'm a climate nerd who spent too much time doom scrolling IPCC reports and decided to be part of the 
renewable energy transition. I am an Idaho-based clean energy consultant focusing on policy at the 
county level. 

Previously, I was the Climate Program Manager for the Idaho Conservation League where I co-developed a 
long-term campaign to accelerate Idaho's decarbonization. I earned my PhD researching how climate change is impacting ecosystems like deserts, grasslands, forests, 
and agricultural areas. Prior to that, I worked on the Tongass and Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forests 
building long-term forest management plans. 

My academic focus areas include soil carbon dynamics, fire effects on ecosystems, permafrost 
soils, biomarker sourcing techniques, and nature based carbon markets. 
You can learn more from my [recorded]({{< relref "/project/phd_dissertation" >}}) PhD defense, 
my [projects]({{< relref "/project" >}}), or my [published]({{< relref "/publication" >}}) journal articles.  

While pursing my graduate degrees at Oregon State I co-produced the 
[Inspiration Dissemination]({{< relref "/project/inspiration_dissemination_memorable_episodes" >}}) 
radio show, podcast, & blog where we translated graduate student research for the public's understanding 
and learned students' personal stories.

I have a robust academic acumen making me a trusted messenger on climate issues, I am media trained and 
experienced in interviews, presentations, teaching, or panel settings, and I know when to mind 
my p's and q's to avoid any cultural faux pas. My ecology and geology background make me happy in the
big-picture thinking arena, and they helped lay the foundations for how to accelerate the 
renewable energy transition. 

I think my skills would be especially valuable for a state entity working on regional 
energy issues. Thus far I've learned so many good lessons on how to solve problems in this space, whether it's working 
at the State Legislature level or phone banking for volunteers to advocate for better renewable energy policies.  
Sometimes you need a long-term strategic policy plan to fix a problem, but sometimes you need to have 
more coffee & windshield time with the locals.

When not working you can find me running in circles, mountain biking, playing soccer, rock climbing, or trying to learn how to ski. To learn more about my history read my [Background]({{< relref "/project/Background" >}}).
