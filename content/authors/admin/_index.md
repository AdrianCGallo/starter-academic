# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I’m trained as a terrestrial carbon biogeochemist (aka I know a lot about dirt). I’m currently exploring science communication and climate change policy through an environmental justice framework as a future career. When not science-ing you can find me running, mountain biking, or playing soccer.

# Adrian (he/him) is currently a Ph.D. candidate in soil science, but he does not want to *be* a soil scientist. It's not for lack of interest. Soils are infinitely complex ecosystems that societies rely on, and his [best writing](https://adriancgallo.com/publication/20-carter-representation/) is in an academic soil journal. Unfortunately, the long list of social injustices are too pervasive in society to remain focused on soils. Adrian is searching for a future career where he can leave Earth and its people in better shape than when he entered it.


# Adrian grew up in California spending summers exploring the Sierra Nevada mountains. Those ecosystems, and the granitic rock outcrops, led him to pursue a degree in soil science with a geology minor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The Learn By Doing motto of Cal Poly directed him towards internships with the USDA Forest Service in both Alaska and Oregon. During those internships he fell in love with temperate rainforests, and wanted to study them further. This resulted in a Masters degree in Forestry from Oregon State University. Nearing graduation from that project, his advisor (Dr. Jeff Hatten) was awarded a grant looking at soil organic matter characteristics in ecosystems across North America. As a consequence of luck and circumstance, Adrian continued onto a PhD program at Oregon State where he expects to complete his degree in late 2021.

# Adrian grew up in California spending summers exploring the Sierra Nevada mountains. Those ecosystems, and the granitic rock outcrops, led him to pursue a degree in soil science with a geology minor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The Learn By Doing motto of Cal Poly led to internships with the USDA Forest Service in both Alaska and Oregon where he was exposed to how soils can better inform land management priorities. Knowing how soils can inform land management decisions, he wanted to continue his soils education in Oregon because of their strong forestry program. He completed his M.Sci. evaluating the biophysical impacts of harvesting, intensive biomass removals, and compaction on soils in the western Cascades. Nearing the time of graduation, his advisor (Jeff Hatten) was awarded a National Science Foundation grant evaluating continental-scale controls on soil organic matter dynamics. He continues this collaboration with the National Ecological Observatory (NEON) network and continues to publish academic articles as part of his dissertation. 

# Adrian (he/him) is currently a PhD candidate at Oregon State University focusing on soil organic matter across ecosystems. His career started at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, where his curiosity and love of the outdoors led him to discover the fields of geology and soil science. He then spent time in both the Tongass (Alaska) and Klamath-Siskiyou (Oregon) National Forests working on long-term forest management plans. His love of California grasslands was overshadowed by his experiences in the Pacific Northwest where he then decided to pursue a MS in forestry at Oregon State University.
