# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I’m trained as a terrestrial carbon biogeochemist (aka I know a lot about dirt). I’m currently exploring science communication and climate change policy through an environmental justice framework as a future career. When not science-ing you can find me running, mountain biking, or playing soccer.

#practice words: He grew up in California spending summers exploring the Sierra Nevada mountains. Those ecosystems, and the granitic rock outcrops, led him to pursue a degree in soil science with a geology minor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. The Learn By Doing motto of Cal Poly directed him towards internships with the USDA Forest Service in both Alaska and Oregon. During those internships he fell in love with temperate rainforests, and wanted to study them further. This resulted in a Masters degree in Forestry from Oregon State University. Nearing graduation from that project, his advisor (Dr. Jeff Hatten) was awarded a grant looking at soil organic matter characteristics in ecosystems across North America. As a consequence of luck and circumstance, Adrian continued onto a PhD program at Oregon State where he expects to complete his degree in late 2021.

Adrian (he/him) is currently a Ph.D. candidate in soil science, but he does not want to *be* a soil scientist. It's not for lack of interest. Soils are infinitely complex ecosystems that societies rely on, and his [best writing](https://adriancgallo.com/publication/20-carter-representation/) is in soil science journal. Unfortunately, the long list of social injustices are too pervasive in society to remain focused on soils. Adrian is searching for a future career where he can leave Earth, and its people, in better shape than when he entered it.

He grew up in California exploring the Sierra Nevada mountains. Those ecosystems, and the unending granitic rock outcrops, led him to pursue a degree in soil science with a geology minor at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. During that time, he worked for the USDA Forest Service in both Alaska and Oregon as a soil scientist. Wanting to continue his curiosity of wildland ecosystems, he went to Oregon State University to complete a Masters in Forestry, and is stayed for a PhD in Soil Science. In his spare time he enjoys mountain biking, running in circles, playing soccer, and is a co-host for the Oregon State science communication podcast, [Inspiration Dissemination](https://adriancgallo.com/project/inspiration_dissemination_favoriteepisodes/).
