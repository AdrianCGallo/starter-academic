summary: The Oregon Labor Day fires of 2020 collectively burned over 1,000,000 acres. That year, more than 10,000,000 acres burned across the western US that caused nearly $20 billion dollars in damages. This study is focused on the post-fire effects on a young industrial timber plantation that we were monitoring very carefully for years prior as part of another project, but it burned up in the Holiday Farm Fire.

abstract: "Forest soils of the Pacific Northwest contain immense amounts of carbon (C). Increasing acreage burned by severe wildfire in the western Oregon Cascades threat- ens belowground C stocks. The objective of this research was to quantify the changes in soil C stocks, nitrogen (N) stocks, and relevant chemical and physical parameters after a severe wildfire in a young, intensively managed Pseudotsuga menziesii (Douglas-fir) tree farm in the western Oregon Cascades. This longitudinal study was originally established to detect soil C changes after a harvest; therefore, it offers insight into long-term soil C dynamics after compounding disturbances. Forest floor and 0–30 cm depth soil samples were collected for comparison before and after the fire and were then split into size fractions to assess the fire’s effect on different grain sizes and forest floor compositions. Overall, soil C was approximately 40 Mg C ha−1 lower after the fire, equivalent to approximately 30% of soil C stocks. Of these decreases, two-thirds were in the forest floor and one-third were in the mineral soil. C stock losses were driven by changes in mass in every composite level. C concentration was unchanged in most levels while N concentration increased in certain levels. Losses extended further belowground than most previously studied soil C decreases from severe wildfire. The effects of wildfire on soil C stocks in industrial tree farms should be further explored to determine long-term trajectories of soil C and N."

#### TLDR

What happens when a bunch of young trees that are all touching each other get caught up in a massive windstorm and a bunch of utility poles fall down and start a fire? It's bad, mmk!

#Before getting into the heart of this paper, it's worth learning about the history of fire suppression in the United States. This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edDZNkm8Mas) is the best way to explain it, but the short version is that European colonizers in North America were pretty scared of fires. Beginning in the early/mid 1900's the newly formed Forest Service was tasked with stopping all fires, and they've been incredibly successful. About 90% of all wildfires since then have been contained to <10 acres, just a small fraction of wildfires actually get big. Because we've prevented any fires from occurring over the last ~110 years, our forests have become "over-stocked" with trees. Your standard landscape ecology textbook will have fire as a natural part of the ecosystem function, but when you eliminate fire you allow trees to grow in all the places they never used to grow; instead of seeing canopy gaps and meadows on mountain tops, everything got covered in trees. Wildfires would naturally thin out these trees, so there was more spacing between each tree allowing them easier access to water and nutrients. Now-a-days, after a 100 years of fire exclusion, trees have a continuous canopy coverage, and they're fighting for water and nutrient resources more than they ever had to in the past. With the advent of longer and more intense droughts due to climate change, there are too many trees fighting for too few nutrients and water, that are all touching branch to branch for thousands of acres. Remember, these forested ecosystems were accustomed to seeing fires somewhat often (1-3 years for oak-savannas, 3-5 years for Ponderosa pines, >50yrs for Douglas-fir, etc..). In a ([continental scale project]({{< relref "/publication/19_gallo_sssa_neon_pyc" >}})), we showed that pyrogenic carbon (partially burned organic matter) was present across all ecosystems and even in soils down past a meter in depth; just more evidence that fires have always been a critical piece of ecosystems. Ok, with that background in mind, what happens to an industrial timber plantation when a fire roars through? 

#Industrial (or intensive) forest management generally means the goal of the land is for wood products and exclusively wood products. The Forest Service (no matter how many environmental NGO's scream about this) does not manage public lands in this way. yes they have areas for timber production, but it's never the *exclusive* goal. Only private companies and private landowners can really manage forests this way. The management strategies includes: high density planting (>300 trees per acre) usually with a herbicide application, one early rotation mechanical thinning, sometimes a mid-rotation thinning treatment, and usually 1-2 fertilizer applications over the 30-40 year timeline. I taught a whole class on the reasons for these strategies, but the short version is that it's more economical and you get stronger lumber products out of it. I often say forestry is just slow agriculture (there's a reason Weyerhaeuser calls their lands "tree farms"), and that's a half-decent metaphor. For many reasons, agriculture is much much worse for the land than industrial forestry, but we're grading on a curve here so I don't want you to think forestry is all unicorns and rainbows. But if you're pissed off about how forests are managed, just wait until you learn more about how agriculture has completely wrecked landscapes.
