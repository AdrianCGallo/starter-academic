summary: Finding carbon in soils is easy, tracing where it came from is hard and tracing that carbon *down* the soil profile is even harder. Here I presented some of my dissertation work where we examine plant derived carbon compounds across the NEON sites, and down soil profiles often reaching 1-meter or more in depth.

#### TLDR

This presentation, focusing on the NEON collaboration, is the culmination of two-thirds of my dissertation. Not all the data were available (PSA: don't extract lipids in plastic falcon tubes because plasticizers screw up the GC-MS signal) but we had a significant portion of across ecosystem & down soil profile information that we could produce a reasonable story. One that runs contrary to some research on where soil carbon comes from and how long it may stick around.
