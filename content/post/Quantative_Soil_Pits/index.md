## Get Started

A few summers back I was helped a campaign to dig 10 quantitative soil pits across the [HJ Andrews Experimental Forest](https://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/about) for the purpose of better understanding one of theh longest studied watersheds in the world. Surprisingly, not many soil scientists had tried to map out the watershed, and it turns out if you care about water, tree productivity, salamander habitat, and basically anything else on soils (i.e. everything) it helps to know what's beneath your feet!
