# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: The NEON project was at its infancy when I began my dissertation. They were literally building and installing the ~30 sites around North America at the same time they were sampling soils for my project. Although my PhD focuses on the soils aspect, there is a wealth of publicly available data being generated that any scientist should be aware of.  

# Slides (optional).

_Be patient ... content still being written._

_This is one of a multi-part series on my collaboration with the National Ecological Observatory (NEON) project, which is also a major part of my dissertation._ 

_Future posts will include:_
- _Soil core collection from the NEON sites_
- _Soil organic matter signatures from NEON sites_
- _Fire histories of NEON sites_




## Background

Long-term data sets are the holy grail for ecology. In the age of rapid climatic transition(s), knowing how ecosystem currently function may help us predict how they will respond in the future. As with all things ecology, everything is connected and nearly all things interact. Want to know about bird populations? You need to know about pollinator species and their abundances, where their plant-foods are, and how rain events or topographical factors determine where those plants may survive. In order to study the outward effect of biological systems, you need to have a firm understanding of the abiotic factors that are present in your area. 

These abiotic factors will never make it onto a Nature Conservancy poster, but they will determine what wildlife can survive in which locations. Beyond charismatic wildlife, global climate change models depend on input data that need to be empirically derived. But collecting these data are **expensive**. It's unlikely an individual research group can gather enough (economic & personal) resources to monitor a site for a few decades. But that's where these large federally-funded research projects can fill the void. 

I like to think of NEON as a version 2.0 of the [Long-Term Ecological Research](https://www.nsf.gov/news/newsmedia/ENV-discoveries/LTER-discovery-series.jsp) (LTER) that started in the 1980's (the National Science Foundation funds both endeavors). The most famous LTER site helped us discover the damage that acid rain was having on Northeastern US hardwood ecosystems. The Hubbard Brook LTER documented  [strong evidence](https://hubbardbrook.org/acid-rain-revisited) that acid rain was (1) linked to human emissions and (2) those emissions were harming terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. This research eventually led to the implementation of the Clean Air Act in 1970, and amendments in 1990. Unfortunately, the effects of acid rain deposition have [lasting effects](https://hubbardbrook.org/sites/default/files/pictures/HBRF/ScienceLinks/acid-rain-revisited.pdf), long after the significant decreases in pollution. 

Research on these LTER's continue today. For example, a [2020 publication](https://www.fs.fed.us/nrs/pubs/jrnl/2021/nrs_2021_campbell_001.pdf) from Hubbard Brook describes what they've learned after decades of cross-disciplinary research: 

> "hydropedological studies have shed light on linkages between hydrologic flow paths and soil development that provide valuable perspective for managing forests and understanding stream water quality.
