# Backup words This is also called *biomarker analysis*. Scientists use it to identify molecules that we know are good tracers from another organism. If we can track it's fate today, maybe we can predict tomorrow. At least that's what I was told when starting a soils PhD. Nonetheless, root-derived biomarker compounds are, luckily, fairly unique and behave well when being subject to pretty harsh acid baths, being incinerated at >350C, then finally being forced through a tiny hot tube of metal for an hour getting high off of Helium (He is our carrier gas for the GCMS). That's whats required for this method, so that we can trace once living Douglas-fir roots into their eventual demise as either CO2 being released to the atmosphere (which I measuered in my MS), to the eventual fragmentation and later incorporation of that new *sub-surface* POC (Particulate Organic Carbon, not Person of Color) as stabilized* soil organic matter. (*Stabilized as a concept in soil science remains poorly defined") In addition to identifying these root-associated biomarkers, we can also examine their relative level of degradation status (the number of hydroxyl groups on these root-biomarkers is an indication of further oxidative processing my microrganisms, more -OH indicates greater degradation and kl)

_Be patient ... content still being written_

_This is one of a multi-part series on this topic, which is also a major part of my dissertation. Read more below:_ 

- _Soil core collection from the NEON sites_
- _Soil organic matter signatures from NEON sites_
- _Fire histories of NEON sites_




## Background

Add stuff about the difficulty in scaling small field trials with [big] data needed for computer models predicting climate change scenarios, Why long-term data collection is crucial, and how the timing of the site installation coincides with me beginning my PhD.

## Case-Study in the Oregon Cascades

Turns out, if you start with fairly productive soils (deep, new volcanic influences, plenty of N), even the most intense perturbations to the above ground ecosystems, the soils bounce back incredibly well. I was very surprised, until I realized this is actually more often the case than not: in *most* of these experimental locations where we harvest all trees and drive a tractor over each square inch multiple times over again until the maximum bulk density could be reached, they didn't do *that much worse* than the other treatments with a fairly gently harvest and haul with minimal impacts kinda processes operated. May I remind you, these sites are some of the most productive forestry soils one could pray for. Moral of the story, if you [err - your soils] got it at the beginning, they probably still got it. They're resilient AF.

But they're not indestructible. Of the 32 one-acre plots, only one had a slope greater than ~30%. That one also happened to be the WTFF removal plot. Bare, compacted bright red soil... on a +30% slope and there was erosion immediately. The rest of the hillside was a remarkably consistent (in Soil Tax speak, the observation plots were on a mid-backslope with a simple-convex south-facing 10-25% slopes). Again, only *one* plot was >25%, and it was the WTFF. Yes, there was certainly erosion. I need to double check, but I'm fairly certain that most industrial forested lands are on slope >30%... 

Anywho, stay tuned for two manuscripts in progress. The first will look at the biophysical responses of these soils to harvesting + harsh compaction treatments. That paper is focusing on responses in soil temperature, moisture, and soil respiration over the three years immediately following the harvest. Even within that two year time frame, the soil ecosystems were still operating remarkably well. That is being prepared for the Forestry Sciences Journal. The second manuscript concerns what mechanisms in soils were able to respond so quickly to these perturbations such that within two years soil carbon didn't change at all. In fact there is some paradoxical evidence that it actually increased. The answer is roots. Roots are quickly decaying into soil, and there was just a _HUGE_ slug of roots that were decapitated from above. We use compound specific spectroscopic techniques (Gas Chromatography Mass Spectroscopy - other scientists consider me a *squiggly line* scientist because of this machine) that can identify the root-chemistry remnants. Just because a root is small, microscopic even, that doesn't mean we can't identify it [winky face]. We're able to trace the once living Douglas-fir roots into and into soils at significant depths such that total soil C storage *increased* slightly in some plots. As new roots begin to grow (via 12x12 spaced seedlings common with industrial practices) we expect the old root-C to continue to be processed and the site will likely reach a new equilibrium near the starting level. Again, these was on a highly productive soil, your results may vary.
