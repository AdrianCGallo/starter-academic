_Be patient ... content still being written_

_This is one of a multi-part series on this topic, which is also a major part of my dissertation. Read more below:_ 

- _Soil core collection from the NEON sites_
- _Soil organic matter signatures from NEON sites_
- _Fire histories of NEON sites_




## Background

Add stuff about the difficulty in scaling small field trials with [big-er] data needed for computer models predicting climate change scenarios, Why long-term data collection is crucial, and how the timing of the site installation coincides with me beginning my PhD.


## National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)

[Big picture](https://twitter.com/AdrianCGallo/status/1082319604070834180) idea of my NEON-associated project.

What was my MS project all about?
