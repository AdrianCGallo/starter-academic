# Overview

I started co-hosting the show because I thought it would just be a fun endeavors to talk on the radio. Before long, I was being exposed to research I **NEVER** knew existed. I had conversations with physicists, biologists, and social scientists. The conversations were always about them presenting their research, but it was also about my (maybe selfish) insatiable curiosity about the world around me. Here are a few blog posts that accompany the episodes. All blog posts can be found on the [Inspiration Dissemination website](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/), and [podcast episodes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?mt=2) are available through 2015. 



- **Winston Kennedy**
  + It's no secret, that the world is built around able-bodied people. Even with the advent of the Americans with Disabilities Act, there are everyday hurdles and limitations disabled people must figure out that other people don't even realize exist.  Oregon State University has an adaptive physical activity program aims to make movement, exercise, and personal development  more accessible for those with mobility limitations. Winston was a practicing physical therapist for a number of years, when he noticed some basic gaps in care that he was not able to provide his patients. Some issues began around primary care physicians not knowing all the benefits of PT. Other, more practical issues, revolved around patients not having the equipment at home to perform the recommended PT exercises. Winston's research aims to better inform primary care physicians on the full benefits of PT and to identify ways to encourage at-home PT exercise to be more successful.
