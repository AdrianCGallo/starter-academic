# Overview

I started co-hosting the show because I thought it would just be a fun endeavors to talk on the radio. Before long, I was being exposed to research I **NEVER** knew existed. I had conversations with physicists, biologists, and social scientists. The conversations were always about them presenting their research, but it was also about my (maybe selfish) insatiable curiosity about the world around me. Here are a few blog posts that accompany the episodes. All blog posts can be found on the [Inspiration Dissemination website](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/), and [podcast episodes](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?mt=2) are available through 2015. 



### Winston Kennedy
Oregon State University has an adaptive physical activity program that builds toy cars for children who are mobility impaired, and examines of ways to make exercise more accessible for those with mobility limitations. It's no secret, that the world is built around able-bodied people. Even with the advent of the Americans with Disabilities Act, there are everyday hurdles and limitations disabled people must figure out that other people don't even realize exist. But it's not *just* disabled people who are in a disadvantaged situation. 

About nine-million Americans have some experience with physical therapy (PT) during their lifetimes (me included!), but Winston was finding that it's really hard for everyday people to perform the physical activity exercises at home because they don't have the equipment, space, or proper guidance (also me included!). Winston was a practicing physical therapist for a number of years, when he noticed some basic gaps in care that he was not able to provide his patients (or lack thereof). Primary care physicians were not recommending (or providing referrals which is needed in the US health care systems) physical therapy to people who could *really benefit* because they simply didn't know what benefits PT offered. Too often, back pains were expected to be cured with pills when core strengthening PT exercises are really what the patient needs. Winston's research examines the lack of knowledge from the primary care physician side, as well as what limits success of PT done in the office vs the home. By understanding the flaws on the front end of getting PT referrals, and PT limitations on the back end, he hopes to make a larger impact that any single PT, like himself, can help to get more people back to doing the activities they love.

Winston was also selected to be part of an annual event we organize with the OSU Graduate School called [Grad Inspire](https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/graduate-student-success/grad-inspire), where you can watch his [speech from the 2020 event](https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_4s2s94e5).
