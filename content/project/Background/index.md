I grew up along California’s San Juaquin Delta, in the shadow of a Chevron oil refinery. Luckily,  I had parents who thought it was cool to hike miles into the Sierra Nevada mountains, poop in holes you frantically dug, and sleep on the ground for fun! (aka backpacking) I was fascinated by how those huge pine trees seemingly grew out of pure granite rock. But the dichotomy of drinking sweet water from alpine lakes for vacations and returning to the “no swimming” Delta waters in my backyard was a bit confusing. That whiplash continues to shape my path today. 

I studied soil science and geology at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo where I spent as much time outside hammering rocks as I did inside analyzing soils. While at Cal Poly, I secured internships with the Forest Service in Alaska and Oregon using soils to inform land management recommendations. Leveraging data gathered from the Oregon internship, and with the help of mentors, I participated in my first true research experience co-authoring a senior thesis on how forest management influenced soil properties. It was about that time I discovered this thing called graduate school where you get [paid to learn](https://twitter.com/ZJAyres/status/1552917560659775489?s=20&t=Tr-P5jzU3cNKVApC1rtnGA) and try to discover new things. How cool is that?!  

The Forest Service internships in Alaska and Oregon helped me realize my love of temperate forests covering the Pacific Northwest. As a result, I pursued a [Masters Degree]({{< relref "/publication/16_Gallo_LTSP_MS_Defense" >}}) at Oregon State University researching a long-term forest soil productivity experiment. Nearing graduation from that project, my adviser ([Dr. Jeff Hatten](https://directory.forestry.oregonstate.edu/people/hatten-jeff)) was lucky enough to be awarded a grant analyzing soil carbon and organic matter dynamics using the newly created National Ecological Observatory Network ([NEON]({{< relref "/project/NEON_Overview" >}})) that is expected to be in operation for the next **thirty-years**. The project was exactly the kind of large scale research I was interested in, so I continued my academic career with Dr. Hatten through a soil science and forest management PhD program and [presented]({{< relref "/project/phd_dissertation" >}}) my research in Fall 2022. 

You might ask yourself, "*how can you spend an entire PhD focusing on dirt?!*" Two surprising facts about soils captured my curiosity. First, soils hold about twice as much carbon compared to our atmosphere. If your [calculation](https://www.globalchange.gov/content/about-soccr-2) include permafrost soils (permanently frozen soils in the cold regions of the world that are quickly warming up), then soils hold 2-3 times more carbon than both the atmosphere and all aboveground plants *combined*. Second, soils use to hold nearly 10% more organic carbon [12,000 years ago](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1706103114) (when the last ice age ended), but most of those carbon losses came within that last 200 years (before the advent of industrial agriculture). Since soils used to hold more carbon, and our land management practices made us lose soil carbon, surely we could manage our way back towards the way things used to be; even if us humans can increase global soil carbon content by just a tiny-tiny bit, it could have climatic-scale benefits.

That is a major reason why I pursued graduate school, because I wanted to learn how soils can be a natural climate solution through changes in land management practices. But soils are so unique across ecosystems - and really expensive to consistently measure - which is probably whyt there were hardly any continental-scale research studies. My [PhD project]({{< relref "/project/phd_dissertation" >}}) looked at almost 40 representative ecosystems across North America and put soils through a battery of tests and analysis to try and learn their secrets to hopefully predict how soils will respond to a changing climate. My experience with NEON had many [collaborations](https://adriancgallo.com/tag/neon) that have produced over 12 peer-reviewed publications and dozens of presentations, so it's tough to summarize. 

Briefly, we did find that soils can be a natural climate solution, but only if we can convince humans to change land management practices *in perpetuity*. For example, when farmers change their practices to minimize soil tilling, or adding cover crops, those do over time increase soil carbon. But the soil carbon increases are tiny each year and difficult to pinpoint relative to the inherently noisy ecological data. Observable increase in soil carbon takes 5-10 years, but the on-farm benefits are seen much sooner than that (less water & fertilizer required, more drought resistant crops, etc...). However, one major flood, a few extra tillage passes, or one major windstorm that removes soils can undo a decade of soil conservation practices. Additionally, if the commodities markets change and different crops become highly valuable, then farmers are likely to expand their plowing footprint (e.g. farmland that was under a voluntary conservation program to leave untouched was quickly plowed and planted when Russia invaded Ukraine eventually spiking wheat demand. See [reporting](https://civileats.com/2022/03/09/the-field-report-what-the-invasion-of-ukraine-means-for-the-food-supply/) in March 2022 where USDA denied the idea of allowing soil conservation areas to be planted, then read the [USDA statement](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/news-room/news-releases/2022/usda-to-allow-producers-to-request-voluntary-termination-of-conservation-reserve-program-contract) in May announcing the exact opposite.). 

Soils are complicated enough to predict on their own - I know because I just spent an entire PhD trying to do it - but how we treat soils today and thirty years from now depends much more on individual farm solvency, global commodity prices, turnover of land ownership, and lobbying through the farm bills among many other things. Soils can be a natural climate solution, but the solutions we have are almost exactly the same recommendations as what scientists recommended after the Dust Bowl (even today, we're making the [same exact mistakes](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2023/05/01/illinois-dust-storm-causes-massive-pileup-closes-traffic-for-30-miles/70172073007/) as we did in the 1930's). Many prominent soil scientists are evangelizing that soils are such a big solution that we can sell soil carbon credits; I'm personally weary of over promising the global potential of soils to return to a higher carbon state, let alone mitigate our excess emissions in the form of carbon credits. We can and should expect soils to provide us the basics: clothing, food, and clean water. As a professor once told me, without soils we'd be cold, hungry, and worse of all sober. Those are still plenty of reasons to appreciate and fight for soils!

While I’ve become deeply enamored by ecosystem sciences and terrestrial ecology, I may not remain in this field. I love understanding - on a biogeochemical level - how soils support global ecosystems, but I think the [soil science field]({{< relref "/publication/20_Carter_representation" >}}) has too narrowly focused our attention and we're missing the true impact of our knowledge. So instead, I hope to use what I’ve learned in my graduate studies and apply that to a more people-centered approach with an [environmental justice](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2022/08/24/environmental-justice-what-it-is-and-what-to-do-about-it/) framework. I’m actively searching for a future career where I can weave together my broad science knowledge from my academic life, science communication skills from my podcasting and blogging days, and my set of personal values. I don't exactly know how to do that yet. One thing is for sure, I am determined to leave Earth - and especially its people - in better shape than when I entered it.
