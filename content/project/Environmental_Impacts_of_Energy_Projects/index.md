# Overview

The Environmental movement in the US was predicated on stopping things because cities were choked in pollution, 
rivers were catching fire, and the countryside was being bulldozed to build houses and freeways with little 
consideration for anything other than rapid growth. I explain this history further in my invited talk to the 
Idaho City Club. 

It's been said the 1960's era Environmentalism that created our bedrock environmental laws (e.g. Clean 
Air/Water Acts, Endangered Species Act, creation of the Environmental Protection Agency) had '*cautious*' themes 
to their policy enforcement. Before new projects started construction, environmental reviews needed to take place 
and check what impacts they would have. We because very cautious builders because of our past mistakes. 

Today's Environmentalists find themselves in an odd position; climate change is a *crisis* and in order to preserve 
the ecosystems we've spent decades trying to protect from direct-human impacts, we need to build a lot of new 
energy projects. The alpine wilderness area of the Sawtooth Mountains will never have wind turbines, but they are now seeing 
less snow pack and more invasive species because of climate change. Just because there is no direct human touch on these
special places, climate change is disrupting these places faster than they can adapt. If we want to save these ecosystems from
collapse, we need to build a lot of new clean energy projects. 

Do you see the juxtaposition yet? 

Below are just a few ways I was able to square that circle when I was working for an environmental non-profit that was well
known for stopping projects of all kinds in the Mountain West because of impacts to the [Greater Sage-Grouse](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/greater-sage-grouse). 
We worked hard to rectify the "*cautious*" Environmentalism that made up a majority of the Idaho Conservation League's 
aging membership with the "*crisis*" Environmentalism that we live in today.

## **The Lava Ridge Wind Project**
In the summer of 2024 I reviewed, [according to Heatmap News](https://heatmap.news/risk-index), 
*the* most at risk energy project in the US. It took me a few days to read through a 2,500 page Final Environmental 
Impact Statement, discuss the implications with my public lands, wildlife, and energy colleagues, and 
[summarize initial impressions](https://idahoconservation.org/blog/blm-releases-final-assessment-of-lava-ridge-wind-project/).

We continued working with other organizations to find out where they stood on the project, and to try and increase 
support if they were movable. We continued to refine our position and eventually were able to support the project that 
is explained in our blog, [The Lava Ridge wind project is not perfect, but it is necessary](https://idahoconservation.org/blog/the-lava-ridge-wind-project-is-not-perfect-but-it-is-necessary/).

There was ... fall out to say the least. Some of the disagreement was in good faith, but it was swamped by the chorus of cultural 
grievances being redirected at all renewable energy projects because they acted as *symbols* of the Biden-administration. 
Fast-forward to February 2025 where Lava Ridge was the only energy project named in an Executive Order 
signed by president Trump that [functionally cancelled](https://idahocapitalsun.com/2025/01/22/president-trumps-executive-order-halts-lava-ridge-wind-project-in-idaho/) 
the project from being built.

This saga is not over because the area in question is the perfect place to build utility scale energy projects. During the FEIS
development the BLM noted there were ~3GW of additional energy projects in various stages of development also on public lands. The 
reason there's so much planned development is because (1) there is large continguous acres of public land, (2) the land is of marginal ecological integrity (see below 
on sagebrush ecosystems), and most importantly (3) the area is crisscrossed by high voltage transmission lines and a newly 
upgraded energy substation. 

As I write this, there are more clean energy projects being proposed on private lands nearby the Lava Ridge
project, and there are more transmission lines being proposed through there. Southcentral Idaho happens to be a geographic triple 
junction where hydropower from the PNW can move eastward, wind power from Wyoming and Montana can move westward, and solar power from the 
desert southwest can move northward. They all converge on the Twin Falls area, and that Midpoint Substation will act like a major 
energy traffic light for the entire [Western grid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Interconnection). 

In a renewables-centric future, we (all the western states) can share our electrons via transmission lines so we don't have to overbuild each and every 
state. If there are regional extreme-weather events that put the grid under immense stress like the [January 2024 cold snap](https://nwenergy.org/featured/customer-side-resources-will-be-critical-as-rising-electricity-demand-extreme-weather-and-climate-change-impact-the-northwest-power-system/), 
the desert southwest can use its excess solar production and send it northward so we don't have blackouts. Having an interconnected
grid helps with cost savings, grid reliability, and it minimizes how many energy projects we need to build. This does mean, however, 
that we need to build a lot more transmission lines even if, as the [Audubon Society argues](https://media.audubon.org/2024-10/Final_BirdsAndTransmission_Audubon2024.pdf), 
there are *some* negative impacts to birds. When giving a TV interview to our local news station I was quoted as saying, "Yes, the 
Lava Ridge Project will kill some birds. But if we don't stop burning dirty fossil fuels then thousands of birds will go 
extinct."


There are no right answers, only trade-offs.

## **Bureau of Land Management's Western Solar Plan**

As hinted at in the authors section of the blog, [Here Comes the Sun: Proactive solar thinking from the BLM](https://idahoconservation.org/blog/here-comes-the-sun-proactive-solar-thinking-from-the-blm/), 
I spearheaded our position on solar development on BLM land. However, it required careful internal conversations with our Public Lands, 
Wildlife, and Energy-focused colleagues. Trying to find the space in the venn diagram where we can all agree was no small feat 
because of our own unique perspectives. Trying to find the literal space on the map where we agreed energy projects can and should go is easier said than done.
This robust effort inside the environmental non-profit world is beginning to seep into the public discourse 
through [Klein and Thompson's Abundance framework](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-ezra-klein-show/id1548604447?i=1000700245818). 

To briefly summarize, Klein & Thompson argue that government "needs to justify itself not though the rules it follows but through the outcomes it 
delivers." They also critique the post-1970s development of "liberal legalism" because it has "convinced itself that 
the state's legitimacy would be earned though compliance with an endless uncatalogued of rules and restraints rather than through getting 
things done for the people it claimed to serve." While many will be sympathetic to these arguments, the policy atmospherics of the book need to
be implemented on the ground. And that's where you find reasonable, but uncomfortable, trade offs. 

Idaho has ~53.5 million acres, 22% is BLM-administered land mostly in the southern portion of the state where you'll find an abundance of 
sagebrush-step ecosystems. Of the 11.7 million acres of BLM-administered land in Idaho, only 0.7% of that (90,000 acres) are reasonably 
foreseeable to have solar on them in a 2050 fully decarbonized scenario. You can imagine how folks felt about public lands having solar on them
when the Western Solar Plan was presented. Of course, there's more outrage today (Summer 2025) now that 21.7 million acres of Forest Service and BLM 
administered lands in [Idaho are up for sale](https://www.wilderness.org/articles/press-release/new-analysis-250-million-acres-eligible-sale-newly-updated-budget-rec-bill).

For decades, the Mountain West has been pressured by [invasive species](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/forest-and-rangeland-ecosystem-science-center/science/cheatgrass-and-medusahead) 
like cheatgrass, Medusahead, and other annual species that are swallowing up the sagebrush sea. But this is an old problem. 
Cheatgrass in particular was likely introduced in the late 1800's by 
[ranchers wanting more feed](https://www.blm.gov/sites/default/files/documents/files/Library_BLMResourceNote63.pdf) for their cattle and the 
invasion front has continued onward ever since. While there are plenty of Sage-grouse in southern Idaho, [new modelling](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1550742424001313?via%3Dihub) 
from the United States Geological Service shows the only place sagebrush (and thus the sagebrush-obligate species Sage-grouse) will survive in Idaho 
is in the upper elevations of the Salmon-Challis National Forest. Think of living in a two story house where you have free roam, but within my 
lifetime the only place you can survive is on the 2nd story, and only on the queen-sized bed. 

Their range contraction is sad, especially so  because there are dozens more species that depend on sagebrush for their life 
cycles as well. Energy balance models used by the USGS are fauna and wildlife-agnostic because they're physics forward. We can lament their range contraction, 
but we cannot pretend like we can maintain sagebrush and sage-grouse in the current places they are today for the next generation. 
There simply won't be enough water, it will be too hot, there are too many invasive species pressures, and wildfires will eat them up 
faster than they can grow. This situation isn't unique to Sage-grouse. There's a [two](https://boiling-point.simplecast.com/episodes/the-lithium-dilemma-at-rhyolite-ridge-part-1-qngbMeho) 
[part](https://boiling-point.simplecast.com/episodes/the-lithium-dilemma-at-rhyolite-ridge-part-2-zoDGJHah) series from 
Sammy Roth's podcast about an endangered flower growing on boron-rich soils that are also at the edge of a lithium mine. Climate 
change is threatening the habitat range of [Tiehm's Buckwheat](https://www.fws.gov/species/tiehms-buckwheat-eriogonum-tiehmii), 
and we need lithium for batteries so that we can stop burning fossil fuels and use renewable energy instead. 

I say above and will reiterate, "there are no right answers, only trade-offs". The intersection of energy and environmental issues are 
where it's most obvious. I encourage you to read the [ICL blog](https://idahoconservation.org/blog/here-comes-the-sun-proactive-solar-thinking-from-the-blm/) 
about BLM's plans for solar development on public lands because it is a real life example of grappling with those issues. It 
doesn't do so perfectly, with the second Trump administration most of these solar plans are on hold, but the careful analysis 
and practicaly constraints are well reasoned to the point that not only did I agree with the BLM, but I convinced my colleagues
to support their preferred project pathways as well. That's a win.
