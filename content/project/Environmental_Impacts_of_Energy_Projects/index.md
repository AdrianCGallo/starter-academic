# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Our ecosystems are under broad threats from climate change, so how should we deal with the acute physical impacts of new energy projects on the landscape?

# Overview

The Environmental movement in the US was predicated on stopping things because cities were choked in pollution, 
rivers were catching fire, and the countryside was being bulldozed to build houses and freeways with little 
consideration for anything other than rapid growth. I explain this history further in my [invited talk to the 
Idaho City Club](https://adriancgallo.com/project/clean_energy_future/). 

It's been said the 1960's era Environmentalism that created our bedrock environmental laws (e.g. Clean 
Air/Water Acts, Endangered Species Act, creation of the Environmental Protection Agency) had '*cautious*' themes 
to their policy enforcement. Before new projects started construction, environmental reviews needed to take place 
and check what impacts they would have. We became very cautious builders because of our past mistakes. 

Today's Environmentalists find themselves in an odd position; climate change is a *crisis* and in order to preserve 
the ecosystems we've spent decades protecting from direct-human impacts, we need to build a lot of new 
energy projects. The alpine wilderness area of the Sawtooth Mountains or Sierra Nevadas will never host wind turbines, but they are now seeing 
less snow pack and more invasive species because of climate change. Just because there is no *direct* human touch on these
special places, climate change is disrupting these places faster than they can adapt. If we want to save these ecosystems from
collapse, we need to build a lot of new clean energy projects. And we need to build them fast. 

Do you see the juxtaposition yet? 

You can read real-world examples of these conflicts for a [wind](https://adriancgallo.com/project/lava_ridge/) and [solar](https://adriancgallo.com/project/blm_western_solar_plan/) projects I dealt with. 
They happened while working for an environmental non-profit with a history
of stopping all kinds of projects in the Mountain West. 
They often leveraged the impacts to the [Greater Sage-Grouse](https://www.audubon.org/field-guide/bird/greater-sage-grouse)
as a way to ensure greater protections for the bird and its habitat. 
Like most non-profits, their culture developed a knee-jerk reaction to project proposals that have any negative impacts. 
Unfortunately, there's no such thing as a zero-impact project. 
You can, however, **avoid** as much of the harms as you can, 
**minimize** the actual impact where possible, and finally **mitigate** the actual impacts you had in other nearby places, 
You should be able to identify this as the "*cautious*" Environmentalism, this framing makes up a substantial percentage 
of memberships/contributers to environmental non-profits. 
But remember, we now have to deal with the "*crisis*" Environmentalism that we exist in today.
