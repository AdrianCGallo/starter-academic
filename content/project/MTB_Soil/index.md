# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: I was riding bikes before I was digging holes, but the more holes I dug the more I liked mountain biking. I was interviewed by a science journalist who like mountain biking and wanted to learn a bit about soil. Especially that sweet sweet loam. 

#Archive words 
## Soil Background From my years presenting at soil-specific conferences I've made a lot of friends while there. One of the connections I made was with a Soil Science Society of America program lead who dealt with the communications side of the organization. She also coordinated the _Soil Matter!_ Blog series which I've contributed to. The field of soil science is small, but Susan Fisk happened to remember me when she received an interview request from NAME NAME to learn about soils in the context of mountain biking. After passing along my contact info, NAME NAME and I met so I could (hopefully) answer all his questions.  

## Biking Background Biking is a hobby today, and will be in the future. I very much enjoy running and soccer, but my knees & hips have seen better days. Mountain biking provides the sweet-spot between aerobic effort and feelings of jedi-ing past trees and ecstatic feelings of weightlessness every once and a while -- all while being low impact on your joints! I knew this when I bought my bike, a 2015 Santa Cruz 5010. I consider this bike my all-mountain quiver-killer (the one bike that can do _all_ the things). For anything on dirt, this bike can ride it, and will ride it until I crack the frame and get a new one (Santa Cruz has a lifetime warranty on their bike frames, a warranty that is known to be rarely used but quickly honored).

## Soil + MTB = Fun
David Shuhltz and I had a short interview where he asked me about some of the best mountain biking trails in the US. I rambled on about soil taxonomy and soil pedology and biking influences on soils. I referenced SoilWeb in our interview, a website where you can discover basically __anything__ about the soil you're standing on (except who's homelands it is, but maybe that's in a future update). Want to know if your soil is good for septic tanks, blueberries vs douglas-fir production, rock content, or even suitability for building construction? SoilWeb has the answers, and a little infographic of what color and how deep the soils are! [Caveat: the programmer is only as good as the data they have available. Since most of the soil mapping, and descriptions, and samplings occurred on agricultural-focused lands, not _everywhere_ has soils information. Large swaths of the deserts, many forests, tidal areas, etc.. do not have soils information.] 

Soil Science Society of America Journal has a science communication arm, where they helped to put David and I in touch. You can find them advertising this [mountain biking story here](https://twitter.com/SSSA_soils/status/1430243897054203905?s=20), and you can follow [David on Twitter](https://twitter.com/dshultz14/status/1428036141387632648?s=20).
