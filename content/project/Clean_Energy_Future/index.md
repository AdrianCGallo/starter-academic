summary: My telling of a 50-year environmental policy history and our many possible clean energy futures

# Overview

This is a presentation I created for the general public that tries to tell a story about the last 50 years of environmental 
policy success, and show how we can do similar great things for energy policy. I connect the passage of the Clean Air/Water, 
Endangered Species Acts and the creation of the EPA to improvements in our world. I then make the case that we're at a similar 
inflection point with the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, but much works remains to be done to address our polluting 
ways

I gave a version of this presentation about five times prior in smaller and larger venues around the State of Idaho. The 
questions I received were very similar throughout the state, and they are identical to ones I hear when I'm back home 
with my family around the holiday dinner tables. The consistency to which I hear the same exact **mis**information is a 
startling indication that the public is genuinely curious and concerned about climate change, but good information is not 
reaching them. 

I have been asked a couple times to consider making this into a TED talk (to which I blush), but until then feel free to 
share this with your friends & family so they're aware of the many positive visions in our near future, if we choose to 
act quickly.
