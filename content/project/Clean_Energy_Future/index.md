summary: My telling of a 50-year environmental policy history and our many possible clean energy futures

# Overview

This is a presentation I created for the general public that tries to tell a story about the last 50 years of environmental 
policy successes and shows how we *can* do similarly great things with energy policy. I also make the argument that what we 
currently describe as energy policy, is inherently pro-environment. I connect the passage of the Clean Air/Water, 
Endangered Species Acts and the creation of the EPA to improvements in our present world. I then make the case that we're at a similar 
inflection point with the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, but much works remains to be done to address our polluting 
ways.

I gave a version of this presentation about five times prior in smaller and larger venues around the State of Idaho. The 
questions I received were very similar throughout the region and they are identical to ones I hear when I'm back home in California 
with my family around the holiday dinner tables. The consistency to which I hear the same exact *mis*information is a 
startling indication that the public is genuinely curious and concerned about climate change, but good information is not 
reaching them. Why is this happening? There's a myriad of reasons, but as a first approximation I recommend Jane Mayer's 2016 book 
*Dark Money: The hidden history of the billionaires behind the rise of the radical right*, or her [2010 New Yorker article](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2010/08/30/covert-operations) 
that spurred the motivation for her book. 

I have been asked a couple times to consider making this into a TED talk (to which I blush), but until then feel free to 
share this with your friends & family so they're aware of the many positive visions in our near future, if we choose to 
act quickly.

### Summer 2026 Update

Although the [second Trump administration's tax bill](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/06/30/upshot/senate-republican-megabill.html?unlocked_article_code=1.CVA.0gV0.TOBaLqxs8MHL&smid=url-share) essentially wiped away the entire Inflation Reduction Act (among many other things), the fundamental reality remains true: 
the energy transition is happening and will continue to happen because it makes *economic sense* (yes, even without any subsidies). The pace of decarbonization will not be as fast, 
but wind, solar, and batteries remain the cheapest and least risky ways to produce electrons.
