# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: I successfully defended my PhD, and had a lot of [type II] fun in the process. You can watch my presentation, look through my slides, and access my *draft* dissertation that still requires more edits before it's finalized. Enjoy.

## Background

I'm providing my written dissertation and presentation slides as I submitted them to my committee. Obviously there are __many__ edits. For example, I was rightfully scolded in the closed door session for saying "lignin content" when I should have said the more cumbersome "lignin contributions to the soil organic carbon pool". 

Nonetheless, I figured providing the deep thinking I've done so far is more helpful than waiting another 3-6 months until it's finally published. Besides, as someone passionate about SciComm I wanted this to be available sooner rather than later. 

This was presented on the 12th of October 2022 
- My defense on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qrPpsV34E0A)
- My presentation notes and [Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YFLgXWVOdiGcBTpRh-1lsenn7OfK03Z5sY7ofKAPm1I/edit?usp=sharing) (with citations/links in the notes section)
- My written [dissertation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IXhnLoeq5YN82jSYodhgGNKZWHJh6YVE/view?usp=sharing) in **draft** form
- Inspiration Dissemination [homepage](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/) & [podcast archive](https://feeds.transistor.fm/inspiration-dissemination)
