# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: The NEON project was at its infancy when I began my dissertation. They were literally building and installing the ~30 sites around North America at the same time they were sampling soils for my project. Although my PhD focuses on the soils aspect, there is a wealth of publicly available data being generated that any scientist should be aware of.

## Background

I'm providing my written dissertation and presentation slides as I submitted them to my committee. Obviously there are __many__ edits. For example, I was rightfully scolded in the closed door session for saying "lignin content" when I should have said the more cumbersome "lignin contributions to the soil organic carbon pool". 

Nonetheless, I figured providing the deep thinking I've done so far is more helpful than waiting another 3-6 months until it's finally published. 

This was presented on the 12th of October 2022 
- My defense on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/qrPpsV34E0A)
- [Slide deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1YFLgXWVOdiGcBTpRh-1lsenn7OfK03Z5sY7ofKAPm1I/edit?usp=sharing) (with citations/links in the notes section)
