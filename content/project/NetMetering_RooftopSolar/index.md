# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: Rooftop solar is a way to clean up the grid and decrease your long-term energy bills. But utilities really don't like competition, even if it comes from the little guys like you.

# Overview
If you are a homeowner and willing to invest $15-30k into your home for a rooftop solar installation, you'd
think you did all the financial math to make sure it pays off. In many states, if often does in a decade or less. 
While there is  an upfront capital cost, over the long term it pays itself off and you spend the next decade paying 
less for your power usage. The policy linchpin that makes this investment vehicle worth it is called *net metering*. 
But how much should you pay for upfront solar investment, how much the utility pays you for the energy you create and the additional
local infrastructure upgrades they need to accommodate more rooftop solar, are **all costs that someone needs to incur**. 
The basic question raised across many State energy offices around net metering all involve who pays and how much. 

## Net metering. Who are you and why are you so slippery?
How much electricity you consume is generally offset by the solar energy you produce, but how you do that net metering 
math makes a big impact on the financial viability of your rooftop solar system.
During the middle of the day, often when people are at work, solar panels on your home produce more energy than 
what your home is using. That excess energy production goes back the grid and with modern smart meters your
utility knows exactly how much electricity you generated for your community. Utilities then compensate you for your energy production
by issuing energy credits (each state/utility works differently, for example some issue financial credits). 
When you return home in the evening and turn on the AC, set the cloths to wash, and begin to make dinner, you 
quickly begin using more energy than your solar panels can generate. 

Idaho Power's original idea of net metering for rooftop solar owners did the electron-math this way: 
if you generated 15kWh (kilowatt-hours) during the day but used 20kWh throughout the evening, then you
should only have to pay for that extra 5kWh energy usage. Idaho Power set up their rooftop solar program
over a decade ago when they had a few dozen rooftop solar customers, but now they have over 12,000 rooftop solar installations. 
It is a *policy failure* that Idaho Power, or really any major investor owned utility (IOU), was unable to innovate 
to encourage more rooftop solar. Remember, IOU's are monopolies regulated by State-level Public Utilities Commission (PUC). 

## The financialization of utilities
We allow them to operate as monopolies, traded on the New York stock exchange, 



However, in this Public Utilities Commission (PUC) case that Idaho Power brought to change this net metering math they 
do have some valid points. 

## A (brief) energy system history

Back in the early 2010's our energy system was still a one way street; coal, gas, and hydropower generating stations were in one place 
feeding electrons to the grid and eventually end users. Energy went one direction and it's the only way it's worked 
since we originally built our power system in the 1900's! 
Lets face it, for the last 20 years utilities and the power sector have been a boring but consistent 2% energy growth 
ecosystems. The last time the power sector experienced anything that required innovation was when air conditioning became
affordable for everyone in the 1970s. So you have this old energy system that hasn't needed to innovate in 
over two decades, the rusty bolts from the 1950's attaching wires onto utility poles grown in 1900-era forests are beginning to show their age, 
and this is the exact time we decided to start making real attempts to switch our entire energy system. 


it's had the same one-way energy highways that were beginning to see some potholes in need of repairs. 

All about the same time, we decided to start building more energy stations that are not dispatchable (i.e. shove more 
coal in a coal plant and you make more electrons, but try controlling the wind that way. Good luck)

decided to do the net metering math
However, and 
honestly they have a valid point why that grandfathered system should not necessarily be continued.

The Climate Solution That’s Horrible for the Climate
June 6, 2023 - https://www.nytimes.com/2023/06/06/opinion/climate-change-biofuels-corn-ethanol.html

We use nearly 40M acres of cornfields to grow ethanol. Nearly 40M acres of solar farms (with some batteries) could easily power the country, even if we all drove EVs and used AI

It takes about 100 acres worth of biofuels to generate as much energy as a single acre of solar panels; worldwide, a land mass larger than California was used to grow under 4 percent of transportation fuel in 2020.
What makes corn-based ethanol distinct from most of our other wasteful agricultural giveaways is that it diverts crops from bellies to fuel tanks and uses almost as much fossil fuel — from fertilizers made of natural gas to diesel tractors, industrial refineries and other sources — as the ethanol replaces.

But the more damaging effect of biofuels, first revealed in a 2008 paper in the journal Science, is that they increase greenhouse gas emissions through the conversion of carbon-rich forests, wetlands and grasslands into farmland, expanding our agricultural footprint while shrinking nature’s. That was tragic back when biofuels seemed like the only plausible alternative to planet-broiling gasoline, but it’s inexcusable now that electric vehicles have become better, cleaner and more economical
