_Be patient ... content still being written_

_This is one of a multi-part series on this topic. Read more below:_ 

- _Pacific Northwest forest management & the potential for biomass harvesting_
- _The Long-term soil productivity (LTSP) experiment, decades later_
- _Soil biophysical responses in the two years following a LTSP installation_
- _Soil organic matter resilience from root-derived carbon in an LTSP experiment_




## Background

Stuff about LTSP, and how it's become an international network of sites


## Northwest Advance Renewables Project (NARA)

Big picture idea of the project, and biofuel harvesting in the PNW


## Case-Study in the Oregon Cascades

What was my MS project all about?
