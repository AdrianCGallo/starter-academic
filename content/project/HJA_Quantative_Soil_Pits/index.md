title: How to dig a perfectly square hole at the HJ Andrews experimental forest
subtitle: Ever wanted to see how perfectly square a cube you could dig? Well neither have I! But it turns out perfectly square holes are ideal for ecosystem-level carbon accounting.

summary: Ever wanted to see how perfectly square a 1x1x1 meter cube you could dig? Well neither have I! But it turns out, ecosystem-level carbon accounting require very precise partitioning of biomass pools to be effective.

_Be patient ... content still being written_

## Some Background

A few summers back I was on a campaign to dig 10 quantitative soil pits across the [HJ Andrews Experimental Forest](https://andrewsforest.oregonstate.edu/about) to better understand one of the longest studied watersheds in the world. Surprisingly, not many *soil* scientists had tried to map out the watershed, and it turns out if you care about water, tree productivity, salamander habitat, and basically anything else on soils (i.e. everything) it helps to know what soil is beneath your feet! 


## Overview

1. Find a spot
2. Tape it out
3. Dig a hole ... **carefully**
4. Measure everything that come out of the hole
5. Record all that lovely data
6. Take photos & samples
7. Have lunch
8. Put everything back where it was before

*I have many cool photos to come!*
