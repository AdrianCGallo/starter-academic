# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: I've been a co-host of this radio show & podcast show beginning in 2014. Each on-air interview is preceded with a written blog post advertising my fellow graduate students. This is a brief overview of some of them.

*Please be patient! After authoring over 30 posts, and participating in countless more interviews, I'm still revisiting all these stories*

# Overview

I started co-hosting the show in 2015 simply because I thought it would be fun to talk to people on the radio. Before long, I was being exposed to research I **NEVER** knew existed. I had conversations with physicists, oceanographers, and social scientists that have helped me grow as a scientist but also an individual. The interviews were always about their research, but it was also partly about my curiosity of the world around me. Below is a short list of the most memorable episodes. All my blog posts can be found on the [Inspiration Dissemination website](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/), or you can access our Apple [podcast page](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?mt=2). If you can only listen to one, scroll down to Holly Horan.

I am the primary author of the blogs listed below unless otherwise noted. 


<br> 

 **Elham Maqsood**
  + This was my *very first* blog post with the Inspiration Dissemination team dating back to 2015. As is common with the show, but especially this interview, it opened up my eyes to issues I had never considered. Elham identified a central limitation to daily activities that conflicted with her identity: How to be a practicing Muslim while also trying to participate in sport that make it exceeding difficult to wear a hijab. As a textile specialist, and practicing Muslim herself, she dedicated her PhD to improving the comfort and security of wearing a hijab while simultaneously allowing full vision and movement of the body. The summer following this interview, had the [first US athlete](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2016/08/08/muhammad-first-us-athlete-to-wear-hijab-at-an-olympics/88408614/) to wear a hijab while competing at the Olympics. 
  + You can read Elham Maqsood's [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2015/09/06/modifying-textile-and-design-to-make-a-modern-hijab/), or download the [audio file](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/o7k2te3r81u5mjxiidzt87abwc3nlxd3) of the interview. Unfortunately, the radio show started in 2012, and the podcast version did not begin until 2016, after the interview with Elham.  

<br> 

**Taylor Hughes**
  + Most of the time science is figuring out all the things that *don't* work. Sometimes, it's accidentally finding out something that *does* work! Taylor stumbled upon a new way for organisms to detoxify their blood through lipid-based (fat) proteins that was previously unknown. His story serves as a reminder how science often finds out new information... by mistakes! 
  + You can read Taylor Hughes' [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2016/06/05/oops-thats-mistake-no-thats-new-detox-pathway/), and download the [audio file](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/vfbjbdcxubnwyssrt8j1gzrx3qxd2uuh). This was conducted just before we got our Apple Podcast page up and running in late 2016 (sorry!). 


<br> 

**Terese Jones** 
  + We often think of college students as young 20-year olds without children. As a result, most of the programs are built around that concept, but it leaves many students falling through the cracks. Terese was a non-traditional graduate student; she had careers working in Chicago with the homeless, and Seattle at a womenâ€™s shelter where she found all these paperwork requirements burdensome and downright confusing! (A prominent article in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/how-government-learned-waste-your-time-tax/619568/) by Annie Lowery makes the argument that not only are these paperwork requirements 'Time Taxes' promoted by both major US political parties, they impact non-white and/or poor people the most even though the rates of fraud are minuscule.) Of the many topics covered in the interview, her research focuses on the *cumulative advantage theory* as a potential explanation for why students of lower socioeconomic status do not succeed to the same degree as their more affluent counterparts. This conversation is as relevant today, as it was in 2016 when it was recorded. 
  + This was such an impactful interview, Terese was selected to be part of the inaugural class of graduate students who told their story through a curated effort with the Graduate School similar to TEDx style talks. You can listen to the [podcast version](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?i=1000410407359) of the 2018 event (originally it was called *GRADx* but due to branding issues, we've since changed the name of the annual even to *Grad Inspire*). 
  + You can read Terese Jones' [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2016/06/26/hurdles-college-education-not-students/), and download the [audio file](https://oregonstate.box.com/s/gi8vhmlney68ovnmcvhrbzk6pj1f9fml). If you enjoy this discussion, be sure to also listen to the episode with Vesna Stone below.

<br> 

**Vesna Stone**
  + She is a visa-lottery recipient from Macedonia (yes, the US has a visa lottery) and worked as cleaner for a computing & manufacturing facility in Corvallis. Vesna worked graveyard shifts while going to school and raising children. Fast-forward a few years and she's helping Oregon residents access food benefits as an Oregon Health Department (OHD) employee. Her new job was helping others in her exact situation not long ago. At OHD she noticed the large hurdles that many people have accessing food benefits, especially university students from accessing food resources. She describes her immigration story, how she wanted to help others like herself as the primary why she worked for the Oregon Health Department. Later in the interview we discuss why she wanted to pursue a higher degree (to make an even stronger impact). If you enjoy this discussion, also listen to the episode with Terese Jones above.

**Sarah Alto**
  + What are zebrafish, why are they model organisms, and how have our (human) lives depended on model organisms!?

<br> 

**Zoe Alley**
  + Our own human perceptions are not as rational as you may hope. 
  + Read Zoe Alley's [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2017/06/04/trust-others-much-trust/), or listen to her [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?i=1000403285501). 



<br> 

**Grace Klinges**
  + A natural ocean CO2 seep she's researching is a perfect time-for-space substitution for what the ocean *could* look like in the nearby future. 
  + Read Grace Klinges' [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2018/01/14/small-differences-big-consequences-keep-oceans-happy/), or listen to her [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?i=1000400174648). 

<br>

**Andrea Haverkamp**
  + It should not be a surprise that Oregon State, being a land-grand university, has a large engineering program dominated by men. But *should* it come as a surprise that the photo of the 2018 SpaceX falcon heavy launch was as white-male dominated as NASA photos during the space race from the 1960's? Andrea's PhD research examines what happens in an engineering workplace that keeps these disparities stable, despite the fact that *"girls get better grades than their male counterparts from kindergarten through high school, girls have a similar level of STEM interest as their male counterparts early in their schooling career and within the last decade women outnumber men among college graduates."*
  + Read Andrea Haverkamp's [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2018/03/04/workplace-woes-women-engineering/) that she primarily wrote and we lightly edited, or listen to the [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?i=1000404907502). 

<br>

**Christina Hospodar**
  + How expensive do you think it is to buy a wheelchair? How about a wheelchair for children? Answer: about $17,000 for a powered pediatric wheelchair. That's insane (~~insert rant on the American health care system~~) and obviously prohibitive for most families. Once you take into account that the way children learn about themselves, others, and the world they inhabit is strongly tied to their own self-mobility and freedom to explore what *they* find interesting, then the stakes of having exorbitantly priced medical devices for children seems criminal. The Social Mobility Lab at Oregon State decided to do something about it; they designed modified ride-on cars for children with a total cost of $200. Christina and her lab are very humble, but I see this interview as one of the most influential because of the way it tied together developmental psychology, health care infrastructure, and applied research into a cohesive story that encourages me that understanding the system(s) can help fix them.

<br> 

**Katherine Lasdin**
  + Everyone has heard of the great pacific garbage patch by now, but what does it look like *inside* plastic-laden fish? Katherine focuses her research off the Oregon coast sampling Rockfish, grinding them to a pulp and testing their extracts for visual and chemical signatures of plastics. In this episode I also learned about Marine Reserves (Federal and State sanctioned), and just how difficult it is to do science without using any plastic or allowing for plastic contamination because it's EVERYWHERE! 
  + Read Katherine Lasdin's [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2019/07/21/are-microplastics-the-new-fish-food/), or listen to the [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?i=1000418309324). If you enjoyed this episode, be sure to listen to Katy Navlenâ€™s episode as well.


<br> 

**Katy Navlen**
  + Ocean plastics are a huge issue, but changing minds is often the first stop to changing policies. Katy focuses her research on Oregon coastal communities where she's using community based social marketing approach because itâ€™s proven more effective in changing behaviors for beneficial outcomes rather than just mass media information campaigns by themselves. 
  + Read Katy Navlen's [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2018/08/18/the-evolving-views-of-plastic-pollution/), or listen to the [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?i=1000418309324).

<br> 

**Holly Horan**
  + If you can only listen to one episode, this is it. 
  + On the surface, Holly's research seems straightforward; pregnancy is stressful. Monitoring maternal stress through hair cortisol sampling can inform policy on when during/after pregnancy are women most stressed, and try and alleviate those stressful time-points for future mothers. But what happens when the community you're researching is a community that were [forcibly] coerced into being test subjects for the development of birth control? What happens when the island you live on has declared bankruptcy to the colonial power that extracted wealth and resources from your lands? What happens when a hurricane rips through your island while your pregnant?  Can you imagine the stress? Neither can I. Holly's research on Puerto Rican women is part social psychology, ethnography, history,  biochemistry; and she did all this as a Puerto Rican who gave birth during her PhD. Holly doesn't know this, but I constantly revisit this interview because of how intertwined history is with our present, and how science can only do so much if the *people* are left out of the conversation.
  + Holly Horan's [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2018/12/09/1487/) was written by [Daniel Watkins](https://danielmwatkins.com), but we both interviewed her in the [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/inspiration-dissemination/id1337404264?i=1000425592871 ).

**Winston Kennedy**
  + It's no secret, that the world is built around able-bodied people. Even with the advent of the Americans with Disabilities Act, there are everyday hurdles and limitations disabled people must figure out that other people don't even realize exist.  Oregon State University has an adaptive physical activity program aims to make movement, exercise, and personal development  more accessible for those with mobility limitations. Winston was a practicing physical therapist for a number of years, when he noticed some basic gaps in care that he was not able to provide his patients. Some issues began around primary care physicians not knowing all the benefits of PT. Other, more practical issues, revolved around patients not having the equipment at home to perform the recommended PT exercises. Winston's research aims to better inform primary care physicians on the full benefits of PT and to identify ways to encourage at-home PT exercise to be more successful. 
  + Read Winston Kennedy's [blog post](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/inspiration/2020/01/26/work-your-body-work-your-brain/), or listen to the [podcast episode](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/winston-kennedy-work-your-body-work-your-brain/id1337404264?i=1000463814035). Winston was also selected to be part of an annual event we organize with the OSU Graduate School called [Grad Inspire](https://gradschool.oregonstate.edu/graduate-student-success/grad-inspire). You can watch his [speech from the 2020 event](https://media.oregonstate.edu/media/t/0_4s2s94e5).
